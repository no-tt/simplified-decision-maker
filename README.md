## What can be answered ?

- Should I purchase a new phone because of its superior camera resolution for photos I never take ?
- Should I drink some lava if I have the flu ?
- Should I set fire to my neighbor's Tesla ?
- Should I set fire to my neighbor ?
- Should I neighbor to fire my set ?
- Should I book an appointment with a psychiatrist because my obsession for fire is getting a bit problematic ?
- Basically any question starting with "Should I"

## What are the odds of having an unsatifying answer ?

According to a study from the _\<insert random institute name here>_, the results are approximatively the same you would get by simply tossing a coin. What were you expecting ?
